[{"book": "PRO", "version": "ASV"}, [{"Chapter": {"text": "The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel:  To know wisdom and instruction;To discern the words of understanding;  To receive instruction in wise dealing,In righteousness and justice and equity;  To give prudence to the simple,To the young man knowledge and discretion:  That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning;And that the man of understanding may attain unto sound counsels:  To understand a proverb, and a figure,The words of the wise, and their dark sayings.  The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge;  But the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.  My son, hear the instruction of thy father,And forsake not the law of thy mother:  For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head,And chains about thy neck.  My son, if sinners entice thee,Consent thou not.  If they say, Come with us,Let us lay wait for blood;Let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause;  Let us swallow them up alive as Sheol,And whole, as those that go down into the pit;  We shall find all precious substance;We shall fill our houses with spoil;  Thou shalt cast thy lot among us;We will all have one purse:  My son, walk not thou in the way with them;Refrain thy foot from their path:  For their feet run to evil,And they make haste to shed blood.  For in vain is the net spreadIn the sight of any bird:  And these lay wait for their own blood;They lurk privily for their own lives.  So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain;It taketh away the life of the owners thereof.  Wisdom crieth aloud in the street;She uttereth her voice in the broad places;  She crieth in the chief place of concourse;At the entrance of the gates,In the city, she uttereth her words:  How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity?And scoffers delight them in scoffing,And fools hate knowledge?  Turn you at my reproof:Behold, I will pour out my spirit upon you;I will make known my words unto you.  Because I have called, and ye have refused;I have stretched out my hand, and no man hath regarded;  But ye have set at nought all my counsel,And would none of my reproof:  I also will laugh in the day of your calamity;I will mock when your fear cometh;  When your fear cometh as a storm,And your calamity cometh on as a whirlwind;When distress and anguish come upon you.  Then will they call upon me, but I will not answer;They will seek me diligently, but they shall not find me:  For that they hated knowledge,And did not choose the fear of Jehovah,  They would none of my counsel,They despised all my reproof.  Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way,And be filled with their own devices.  For the backsliding of the simple shall slay them,And the careless ease of fools shall destroy them.  But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell securely,And shall be quiet without fear of evil.", "verses": ["The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel:  ", "To know wisdom and instruction;To discern the words of understanding;  ", "To receive instruction in wise dealing,In righteousness and justice and equity;  ", "To give prudence to the simple,To the young man knowledge and discretion:  ", "That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning;And that the man of understanding may attain unto sound counsels:  ", "To understand a proverb, and a figure,The words of the wise, and their dark sayings.

And, behold, there met him a womanWith the attire of a harlot, and wily of heart.  (She is clamorous and wilful;Her feet abide not in her house:  Now she is in the streets, now in the broad places,And lieth in wait at every corner.)  So she caught him, and kissed him,  And with an impudent face she said unto him:  Sacrifices of peace-offerings are with me;This day have I paid my vows.  Therefore came I forth to meet thee,Diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.  I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry,With striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.  I have perfumed my bedWith myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.  Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning;Let us solace ourselves with loves.  For the man is not at home;He is gone a long journey:  He hath taken a bag of money with him;He will come home at the full moon.

There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes,And yet are not washed from their filthiness.  There is a generation, oh how lofty are their eyes!And their eyelids are lifted up.  There is a generation whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives,To devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.  The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give.There are three things that are never satisfied,  Yea, four that say not, Enough:  Sheol; and the barren womb;The earth that is not satisfied with water;And the fire that saith not, Enough.  The eye that mocketh at his father,And despiseth to obey his mother,The ravens of the valley shall pick it out,And the young eagles shall eat it.  There are three things which are too wonderful for me,Yea, four which I know not:  The way of an eagle in the air;The way of a serpent upon a rock;The way of a ship in the midst of the sea;And the way of a man with a maiden.  So is the way of an adulterous woman;She eateth, and wipeth her mouth,And saith, I have done no wickedness.  For three things the earth doth tremble,And for four, which it cannot bear:  For a servant when he is king;And a fool when he is filled with food;  For an odious woman when she is married;And a handmaid that is heir to her mistress.  There are four things which are little upon the earth,But they are exceeding wise:  The ants are a people not strong,Yet they provide their food in the summer;  The conies are but a feeble folk,Yet make they their houses in the rocks;  The locusts have no king,Yet go they forth all of them by bands;  The lizard taketh hold with her hands,Yet is she in kings' palaces.  There are three things which are stately in their march,Yea, four which are stately in going:  The lion, which is mightiest among beasts,And turneth not away for any;  The greyhound; the he-goat also;And the king against whom there is no rising up.  If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself,Or if thou hast thought evil,  Lay thy hand upon thy mouth.  For the churning of milk bringeth forth butter,And the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood;So the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.", "verses": ["The words of Agur the son of Jakeh; the oracle.The man saith unto Ithiel, unto Ithiel and Ucal:  ", "Surely I am more brutish than any man,And have not the understanding of a man;  ", "And I have not learned wisdom,Neither have I the knowledge of the Holy One.

What, my son? and what, O son of my womb?And what, O son of my vows?  Give not thy strength unto women,Nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.  It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine;Nor for princes to say, Where is strong drink?  Lest they drink, and forget the law,And pervert the justice due to any that is afflicted.  Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish,And wine unto the bitter in soul:  Let him drink, and forget his poverty,And remember his misery no more.  Open thy mouth for the dumb,In the cause of all such as are left desolate.  Open thy mouth, judge righteously,And minister justice to the poor and needy.  A worthy woman who can find?For her price is far above rubies.  The heart of her husband trusteth in her,And he shall have no lack of gain.  She doeth him good and not evilAll the days of her life.  She seeketh wool and flax,And worketh willingly with her hands.  She is like the merchant-ships;She bringeth her bread from afar.  She riseth also while it is yet night,And giveth food to her household,And their task to her maidens.  She considereth a field, and buyeth it;With the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.  She girdeth her loins with strength,And maketh strong her arms.  She perceiveth that her merchandise is profitable;Her lamp goeth not out by night.  She layeth her hands to the distaff,And her hands hold the spindle.  She stretcheth out her hand to the poor;Yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.  She is not afraid of the snow for her household;For all her household are clothed with scarlet.  She maketh for herself carpets of tapestry;Her clothing is fine linen and purple.  Her husband is known in the gates,When he sitteth among the elders of the land.  She maketh linen garments and selleth them,And delivereth girdles unto the merchant.  Strength and dignity are her clothing;And she laugheth at the time to come.  She openeth her mouth with wisdom;And the law of kindness is on her tongue.  She looketh well to the ways of her household,And eateth not the bread of idleness.  Her children rise up, and call her blessed;Her husband also, and he praiseth her, saying:  Many daughters have done worthily,But thou excellest them all.  Grace is deceitful, and beauty is vain;  But a woman that feareth Jehovah, she shall be praised.
