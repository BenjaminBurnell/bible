(It takes eleven days to go from Horeb to Kadesh Barnea by the Mount Seir road.)   In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses proclaimed to the Israelites all that the  Lord   This was after he had defeated Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, and at Edrei had defeated Og king of Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth.   East of the Jordan in the territory of Moab, Moses began to expound this law, saying:   The  Lord   Break camp and advance into the hill country of the Amorites; go to all the neighboring peoples in the Arabah, in the mountains, in the western foothills, in the Negev and along the coast, to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, as far as the great river, the Euphrates.  See, I have given you this land. Go in and take possession of the land the  Lord     At that time I said to you, \"You are too heavy a burden for me to carry alone.  The  Lord   May the  Lord , the God of your ancestors, increase you a thousand times and bless you as he has promised!  But how can I bear your problems and your burdens and your disputes all by myself?  Choose some wise, understanding and respected men from each of your tribes, and I will set them over you.\"   You answered me, \"What you propose to do is good.\"   So I took the leading men of your tribes, wise and respected men, and appointed them to have authority over you\u2014as commanders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens and as tribal officials.  And I charged your judges at that time, \"Hear the disputes between your people and judge fairly, whether the case is between two Israelites or between an Israelite and a foreigner residing among you.  Do not show partiality in judging; hear both small and great alike. Do not be afraid of anyone, for judgment belongs to God. Bring me any case too hard for you, and I will hear it.\"  And at that time I told you everything you were to do.

They left and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshkol and explored it.
