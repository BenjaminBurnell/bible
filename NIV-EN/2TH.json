Don't let anyone deceive you in any way, for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness   He will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called God or is worshiped, so that he sets himself up in God's temple, proclaiming himself to be God.   Don't you remember that when I was with you I used to tell you these things?  And now you know what is holding him back, so that he may be revealed at the proper time.  For the secret power of lawlessness is already at work; but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way.  And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming.  The coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with how Satan works. He will use all sorts of displays of power through signs and wonders that serve the lie,  and all the ways that wickedness deceives those who are perishing. They perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.  For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie  and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness.   But we ought always to thank God for you, brothers and sisters loved by the Lord, because God chose you as firstfruits   He called you to this through our gospel, that you might share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.   So then, brothers and sisters, stand firm and hold fast to the teachings     May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and by his grace gave us eternal encouragement and good hope,  encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good deed and word.", "verses": [" Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to him, we ask you, brothers and sisters, ", " not to become easily unsettled or alarmed by the teaching allegedly from us\u2014whether by a prophecy or by word of mouth or by letter\u2014asserting that the day of the Lord has already come.

They are not busy; they are busybodies.  Such people we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and earn the food they eat.

Do not associate with them, in order that they may feel ashamed.  Yet do not regard them as an enemy, but warn them as you would a fellow believer.   Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with all of you.
