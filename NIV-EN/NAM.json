The Lord is a jealous and avenging God;the Lord takes vengeance and is filled with wrath.The Lord takes vengeance on his foesand vents his wrath against his enemies.  The Lord is slow to anger but great in power;the Lord will not leave the guilty unpunished.His way is in the whirlwind and the storm,and clouds are the dust of his feet.  He rebukes the sea and dries it up;he makes all the rivers run dry.Bashan and Carmel witherand the blossoms of Lebanon fade.  The mountains quake before himand the hills melt away.The earth trembles at his presence,the world and all who live in it.  Who can withstand his indignation?Who can endure his fierce anger?His wrath is poured out like fire;the rocks are shattered before him.  The Lord is good,a refuge in times of trouble.He cares for those who trust in him,  but with an overwhelming floodhe will make an end of Nineveh;he will pursue his foes into the realm of darkness.  Whatever they plot against the Lordhe will bring to an end;trouble will not come a second time.  They will be entangled among thornsand drunk from their wine;they will be consumed like dry stubble.  From you, Nineveh, has one come forthwho plots evil against the Lordand devises wicked plans.  This is what the Lord says:\"Although they have allies and are numerous,they will be destroyed and pass away.Although I have afflicted you, Judah,I will afflict you no more.  Now I will break their yoke from your neckand tear your shackles away.\"  The Lord has given a command concerning you, Nineveh:\"You will have no descendants to bear your name.I will destroy the images and idolsthat are in the temple of your gods.I will prepare your grave,for you are vile.\"  ", "verses": ["A prophecy concerning Nineveh.
