The Lord is my rock, my fortress and my deliverer;my God is my rock, in whom I take refuge,my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold.

The cords of the grave coiled around me;the snares of death confronted me.  In my distress I called to the Lord;I cried to my God for help.From his temple he heard my voice;my cry came before him, into his ears.  The earth trembled and quaked,and the foundations of the mountains shook;they trembled because he was angry.  Smoke rose from his nostrils;consuming fire came from his mouth,burning coals blazed out of it.  He parted the heavens and came down;dark clouds were under his feet.  He mounted the cherubim and flew;he soared on the wings of the wind.  He made darkness his covering, his canopy around him\u2014the dark rain clouds of the sky.  Out of the brightness of his presence clouds advanced,with hailstones and bolts of lightning.  The Lord thundered from heaven;the voice of the Most High resounded.  He shot his arrows and scattered the enemy,with great bolts of lightning he routed them.  The valleys of the sea were exposedand the foundations of the earth laid bareat your rebuke, Lord,at the blast of breath from your nostrils.  He reached down from on high and took hold of me;he drew me out of deep waters.  He rescued me from my powerful enemy,from my foes, who were too strong for me.  They confronted me in the day of my disaster,but the Lord was my support.  He brought me out into a spacious place;he rescued me because he delighted in me.  The Lord has dealt with me according to my righteousness;according to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me.  For I have kept the ways of the Lord;I am not guilty of turning from my God.  All his laws are before me;I have not turned away from his decrees.  I have been blameless before himand have kept myself from sin.  The Lord has rewarded me according to my righteousness,according to the cleanness of my hands in his sight.  To the faithful you show yourself faithful,to the blameless you show yourself blameless,  to the pure you show yourself pure,but to the devious you show yourself shrewd.  You save the humblebut bring low those whose eyes are haughty.  You, Lord, keep my lamp burning;my God turns my darkness into light.  With your help I can advance against a troop;with my God I can scale a wall.  As for God, his way is perfect:The Lord's word is flawless;he shields all who take refuge in him.  For who is God besides the Lord?And who is the Rock except our God?  It is God who arms me with strengthand keeps my way secure.  He makes my feet like the feet of a deer;he causes me to stand on the heights.  He trains my hands for battle;my arms can bend a bow of bronze.  You make your saving help my shield,and your right hand sustains me;your help has made me great.  You provide a broad path for my feet,so that my ankles do not give way.  I pursued my enemies and overtook them;I did not turn back till they were destroyed.  I crushed them so that they could not rise;they fell beneath my feet.

The men of Ephraim, though armed with bows,turned back on the day of battle;  they did not keep God's covenantand refused to live by his law.  They forgot what he had done,the wonders he had shown them.  He did miracles in the sight of their ancestorsin the land of Egypt, in the region of Zoan.  He divided the sea and led them through;he made the water stand up like a wall.  He guided them with the cloud by dayand with light from the fire all night.  He split the rocks in the wildernessand gave them water as abundant as the seas;  he brought streams out of a rocky cragand made water flow down like rivers.  But they continued to sin against him,rebelling in the wilderness against the Most High.  They willfully put God to the testby demanding the food they craved.  They spoke against God;they said, \"Can God reallyspread a table in the wilderness?  True, he struck the rock,and water gushed out,streams flowed abundantly,but can he also give us bread?Can he supply meat for his people?\"  When the Lord heard them, he was furious;his fire broke out against Jacob,and his wrath rose against Israel,  for they did not believe in Godor trust in his deliverance.  Yet he gave a command to the skies aboveand opened the doors of the heavens;  he rained down manna for the people to eat,he gave them the grain of heaven.  Human beings ate the bread of angels;he sent them all the food they could eat.  He let loose the east wind from the heavensand by his power made the south wind blow.

But then they would flatter him with their mouths,lying to him with their tongues;  their hearts were not loyal to him,they were not faithful to his covenant.  Yet he was merciful;he forgave their iniquitiesand did not destroy them.Time after time he restrained his angerand did not stir up his full wrath.  He remembered that they were but flesh,a passing breeze that does not return.  How often they rebelled against him in the wildernessand grieved him in the wasteland!  Again and again they put God to the test;they vexed the Holy One of Israel.  They did not remember his power\u2014the day he redeemed them from the oppressor,  the day he displayed his signs in Egypt,his wonders in the region of Zoan.  He turned their river into blood;they could not drink from their streams.  He sent swarms of flies that devoured them,and frogs that devastated them.  He gave their crops to the grasshopper,their produce to the locust.  He destroyed their vines with hailand their sycamore-figs with sleet.  He gave over their cattle to the hail,their livestock to bolts of lightning.  He unleashed against them his hot anger,his wrath, indignation and hostility\u2014a band of destroying angels.  He prepared a path for his anger;he did not spare them from deathbut gave them over to the plague.  He struck down all the firstborn of Egypt,the firstfruits of manhood in the tents of Ham.  But he brought his people out like a flock;he led them like sheep through the wilderness.  He guided them safely, so they were unafraid;but the sea engulfed their enemies.  And so he brought them to the border of his holy land,to the hill country his right hand had taken.  He drove out nations before themand allotted their lands to them as an inheritance;he settled the tribes of Israel in their homes.  But they put God to the testand rebelled against the Most High;they did not keep his statutes.  Like their ancestors they were disloyal and faithless,as unreliable as a faulty bow.  They angered him with their high places;they aroused his jealousy with their idols.  When God heard them, he was furious;he rejected Israel completely.  He abandoned the tabernacle of Shiloh,the tent he had set up among humans.  He sent the ark of his might into captivity,his splendor into the hands of the enemy.  He gave his people over to the sword;he was furious with his inheritance.  Fire consumed their young men,and their young women had no wedding songs;  their priests were put to the sword,and their widows could not weep.  Then the Lord awoke as from sleep,as a warrior wakes from the stupor of wine.  He beat back his enemies;he put them to everlasting shame.  Then he rejected the tents of Joseph,he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim;  but he chose the tribe of Judah,Mount Zion, which he loved.  He built his sanctuary like the heights,like the earth that he established forever.  He chose David his servantand took him from the sheep pens;  from tending the sheep he brought himto be the shepherd of his people Jacob,of Israel his inheritance.
