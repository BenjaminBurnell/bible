The child grew, and one day he went out to his father, who was with the reapers.  He said to his father, \"My head! My head!\" His father told a servant, \"Carry him to his mother.\"  After the servant had lifted him up and carried him to his mother, the boy sat on her lap until noon, and then he died.  She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, then shut the door and went out.   She called her husband and said, \"Please send me one of the servants and a donkey so I can go to the man of God quickly and return.\"   \"Why go to him today?\" he asked. \"It's not the New Moon or the Sabbath.\" \"That's all right,\" she said.

He went in, shut the door on the two of them and prayed to the  Lord .  Then he got on the bed and lay on the boy, mouth to mouth, eyes to eyes, hands to hands.

When he returned, he cut them up into the pot of stew, though no one knew what they were.  The stew was poured out for the men, but as they began to eat it, they cried out, \"Man of God, there is death in the pot!\" And they could not eat it.   Elisha said, \"Get some flour.\" He put it into the pot and said, \"Serve it to the people to eat.\" And there was nothing harmful in the pot.
