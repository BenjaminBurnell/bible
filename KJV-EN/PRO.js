A wise man will hear, and will increase learning;And a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:  To understand a proverb, and the interpretation;The words of the wise, and their dark sayings.  The fear of the LORD  is the beginning of knowledge:  But fools despise wisdom and instruction.  My son, hear the instruction of thy father,And forsake not the law of thy mother:  For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head,And chains about thy neck.  My son, if sinners entice thee,Consent thou not.  If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood,Let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:  Let us swallow them up alive as the grave;And whole, as those that go down into the pit:  We shall find all precious substance,We shall fill our houses with spoil:  Cast in thy lot among us;Let us all have one purse:  My son, walk not thou in the way with them;Refrain thy foot from their path:  For their feet run to evil,And make haste to shed blood.  Surely in vain the net is spreadIn the sight of any bird.  And they lay wait for their own blood;They lurk privily for their own lives.  So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain;  Which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.  Wisdom crieth without;She uttereth her voice in the streets:  She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates:In the city she uttereth her words, saying,  How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity?And the scorners delight in their scorning,And fools hate knowledge?  Turn you at my reproof:Behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you,I will make known my words unto you.  Because I have called, and ye refused;I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;  But ye have set at nought all my counsel,And would none of my reproof:  I also will laugh at your calamity;I will mock when your fear cometh;  When your fear cometh as desolation,And your destruction cometh as a whirlwind;When distress and anguish cometh upon you.  Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer;They shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:  For that they hated knowledge,And did not choose the fear of the LORD:  They would none of my counsel:They despised all my reproof.  Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way,And be filled with their own devices.  For the turning away of the simple shall slay them,And the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.

For at the window of my houseI looked through my casement,  And beheld among the simple ones,I discerned among the youths,A young man void of understanding,  Passing through the street near her corner;And he went the way to her house,  In the twilight, in the evening,In the black and dark night:  And, behold, there met him a woman  With the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.  (She is loud and stubborn;Her feet abide not in her house:  Now is she without, now in the streets,And lieth in wait at every corner.)  So she caught him, and kissed him,  And with an impudent face said unto him,    I have peace offerings with me;This day have I payed my vows.  Therefore came I forth to meet thee,Diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.  I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry,With carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.  I have perfumed my bedWith myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.  Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning:Let us solace ourselves with loves.  For the goodman is not at home,He is gone a long journey:  He hath taken a bag of money with him,  And will come home at the day appointed.  With her much fair speech she caused him to yield,With the flattering of her lips she forced him.  He goeth after her straightway,As an ox goeth to the slaughter,Or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;  Till a dart strike through his liver;As a bird hasteth to the snare,And knoweth not that it is for his life.

The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give.There are three things that are never satisfied,  Yea, four things say not,  It is enough:  The grave; and the barren womb;The earth that is not filled with water;And the fire that saith not, It is enough.  The eye that mocketh at his father,And despiseth to obey his mother,The ravens of the valley shall pick it out,And the young eagles shall eat it.  There be three things which are too wonderful for me,Yea, four which I know not:  The way of an eagle in the air;The way of a serpent upon a rock;The way of a ship in the midst of the sea;And the way of a man with a maid.  Such is the way of an adulterous woman;She eateth, and wipeth her mouth,And saith, I have done no wickedness.  For three things the earth is disquieted,And for four which it cannot bear:  For a servant when he reigneth;And a fool when he is filled with meat;  For an odious woman when she is married;And an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.  There be four things which are little upon the earth,But they are exceeding wise:  The ants are a people not strong,Yet they prepare their meat in the summer;  The conies are but a feeble folk,Yet make they their houses in the rocks;  The locusts have no king,Yet go they forth all of them by bands;  The spider taketh hold with her hands,And is in kings' palaces.  There be three things which go well,Yea, four are comely in going:  A lion which is strongest among beasts,And turneth not away for any;  An greyhound; an he goat also;And a king, against whom there is no rising up.  If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself,Or if thou hast thought evil,  Lay thine hand upon thy mouth.  Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter,And the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood:So the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.", "verses": ["The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy:The man spake unto Ithiel,even unto Ithiel and Ucal,  ", "Surely I am more brutish than any man,And have not the understanding of a man.

What, my son? and what, the son of my womb?And what, the son of my vows?  Give not thy strength unto women,Nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.    It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine;Nor for princes strong drink:  Lest they drink, and forget the law,And pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.  Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish,And wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.  Let him drink, and forget his poverty,And remember his misery no more.  Open thy mouth for the dumbIn the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.  Open thy mouth, judge righteously,And plead the cause of the poor and needy.  Who can find a virtuous woman?For her price is far above rubies.  The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her,So that he shall have no need of spoil.  She will do him good and not evilAll the days of her life.  She seeketh wool, and flax,And worketh willingly with her hands.  She is like the merchants' ships;She bringeth her food from afar.  She riseth also while it is yet night,And giveth meat to her household,And a portion to her maidens.  She considereth a field, and buyeth it:With the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.  She girdeth her loins with strength,And strengtheneth her arms.  She perceiveth that her merchandise is good:Her candle goeth not out by night.  She layeth her hands to the spindle,And her hands hold the distaff.  She stretcheth out her hand to the poor;Yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.  She is not afraid of the snow for her household:For all her household are clothed with scarlet.  She maketh herself coverings of tapestry;Her clothing is silk and purple.  Her husband is known in the gates,When he sitteth among the elders of the land.  She maketh fine linen, and selleth it;And delivereth girdles unto the merchant.  Strength and honour are her clothing;And she shall rejoice in time to come.  She openeth her mouth with wisdom;And in her tongue is the law of kindness.  She looketh well to the ways of her household,And eateth not the bread of idleness.  Her children arise up, and call her blessed;Her husband also, and he praiseth her.  Many daughters have done virtuously,But thou excellest them all.  Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain:  But a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.
