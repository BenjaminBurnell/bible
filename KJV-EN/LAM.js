Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction,And because of great servitude:She dwelleth among the heathen,She findeth no rest:All her persecutors overtook herBetween the straits.  The ways of Zion do mourn,Because none come to the solemn feasts:All her gates are desolate:Her priests sigh,Her virgins are afflicted,And she is in bitterness.  Her adversaries are the chief,Her enemies prosper;For the LORD hath afflicted herFor the multitude of her transgressions:Her children are goneInto captivity before the enemy.  And from the daughter of ZionAll her beauty is departed:Her princes are become like harts  That find no pasture,And they are gone without strengthBefore the pursuer.  Jerusalem rememberedIn the days of her affliction and of her miseriesAll her pleasant thingsThat she had in the days of old,When her people fell into the hand of the enemy,And none did help her:The adversaries saw her,  And did mock at her sabbaths.  Jerusalem hath grievously sinned;Therefore she is removed:All that honoured her despise her,Because they have seen her nakedness:Yea, she sigheth,And turneth backward.  Her filthiness is in her skirts;She remembereth not her last end;Therefore she came down wonderfully:She had no comforter.O LORD, behold my affliction:For the enemy hath magnified himself.  The adversary hath spread out his handUpon all her pleasant things:For she hath seen that the heathenEntered into her sanctuary,Whom thou didst command  That they should not enter into thy congregation.

Is it nothing to you,All ye that pass by?Behold, and see if there be any sorrowLike unto my sorrow, which is done unto me,Wherewith the LORD hath afflicted  Me in the day of his fierce anger.  From above hath he sent fire into my bones,And it prevaileth against them:He hath spread a net for my feet,He hath turned me back:He hath made me desolate  And faint all the day.  The yoke of my transgressions is boundBy his hand:They are wreathed, and come up upon my neck:He hath made my strength to fall,The Lord hath delivered me into their hands,  From whom I am not able to rise up.  The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty menIn the midst of me:He hath called an assembly against meTo crush my young men:The Lord hath trodden the virgin,The daughter of Judah, as in a winepress.  For these things I weep;Mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water,Because the comforter that should relieve mySoul is far from me:My children are desolate,Because the enemy prevailed.  Zion spreadeth forth her hands,  And there is none to comfort her:The LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob,  That his adversaries should be round about him:Jerusalem is asA menstruous woman among them.  The LORD is righteous;For I have rebelled against his commandment:Hear, I pray you, all people,And behold my sorrow:My virgins and my young menAre gone into captivity.

We gat our bread with the peril of our livesBecause of the sword of the wilderness.  Our skin was black like an ovenBecause of the terrible famine.

They took the young men to grind,And the children fell under the wood.  The elders have ceased from the gate,The young men from their musick.  The joy of our heart is ceased;Our dance is turned into mourning.  The crown is fallen from our head:Woe unto us, that we have sinned!  For this our heart is faint;For these things our eyes are dim.  Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate,The foxes walk upon it.  Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever;Thy throne from generation to generation.  Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever,  And forsake us so long time?  Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned;Renew our days as of old.
