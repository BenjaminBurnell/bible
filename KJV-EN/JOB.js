[{"book": "JOB", "version": "KJV"}, [{"Chapter": {"text": "There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil. And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters. His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east. And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.  Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them. And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it. And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought? Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face. And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.  And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house: and there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them: and the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house: and, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.  Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped, and said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD. In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.", "verses": ["There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.

And Job spake, and said,  Let the day perish wherein I was born,And the night in which it was said,There is a man child conceived.  Let that day be darkness;Let not God regard it from above,Neither let the light shine upon it.  Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it;Let a cloud dwell upon it;Let the blackness of the day terrify it.    As for that night, let darkness seize upon it;Let it not be joined unto the days of the year,Let it not come into the number of the months.  Lo, let that night be solitary,Let no joyful voice come therein.  Let them curse it that curse the day,Who are ready to raise up their mourning.

For now should I have lain still and been quiet,I should have slept: then had I been at rest,  With kings and counsellors of the earth,Which built desolate places for themselves;  Or with princes that had gold,Who filled their houses with silver:  Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been;As infants which never saw light.  There the wicked cease from troubling;And there the weary be at rest.    There the prisoners rest together;They hear not the voice of the oppressor.  The small and great are there;And the servant is free from his master.  Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery,And life unto the bitter in soul;  Which long for death, but it cometh not;And dig for it more than for hid treasures;  Which rejoice exceedingly,  And are glad, when they can find the grave?    Why is light given to a man whose way is hid,And whom God hath hedged in?  For my sighing cometh before I eat,And my roarings are poured out like the waters.

Will he make a covenant with thee?Wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?  Wilt thou play with him as with a bird?Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?  Shall the companions make a banquet of him?Shall they part him among the merchants?  Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons?Or his head with fish spears?  Lay thine hand upon him,Remember the battle, do no more.  Behold, the hope of him is in vain:Shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?  None is so fierce that dare stir him up:Who then is able to stand before me?  Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him?  Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.

Out of his nostrils goeth smoke,As out of a seething pot or caldron.  His breath kindleth coals,And a flame goeth out of his mouth.  In his neck remaineth strength,And sorrow is turned into joy before him.  The flakes of his flesh are joined together:They are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.  His heart is as firm as a stone;Yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.  When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid:By reason of breakings they purify themselves.  The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold:The spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.  He esteemeth iron as straw,  And brass as rotten wood.  The arrow cannot make him flee:Slingstones are turned with him into stubble.  Darts are counted as stubble:He laugheth at the shaking of a spear.  Sharp stones are under him:He spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.  He maketh the deep to boil like a pot:He maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.  He maketh a path to shine after him;  One would think the deep to be hoary.  Upon earth there is not his like,Who is made without fear.

Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge?Therefore have I uttered that I understood not;Things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.  Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak:I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.  I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear:But now mine eye seeth thee.  Wherefore I abhor myself, and repentIn dust and ashes.  And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.  Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job. So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job. And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before. Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold. So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses. He had also seven sons and three daughters. And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch. And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren. After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.
